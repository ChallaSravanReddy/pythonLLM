User Question: Multiply 9 and 8, and also tell me the capital of Japan.
Response:
Step-by-step response to mixed query:

1. **Query Analysis**: Your question contains both mathematical operations and general knowledge questions
2. **Level 2 Limitation**: I can only handle one type of operation at a time
3. **Recommendation**: Please ask your questions separately:
   • First, ask the mathematical question
   • Then, ask the general knowledge question
4. **Example**: Instead of "Multiply 9 and 8, and also tell me the capital of Japan"
   • Ask: "What is 9 times 8?"
   • Then ask: "What is the capital of Japan?"
5. **Future Enhancement**: Multi-step processing will be available in Level 3

This ensures accurate and complete responses to each part of your question.

User Question: Multiply 9 and 8, and also tell me the capital of Japan.
Response:
I need to explain why I can't process this mixed query in Level 2:

1. **Query Analysis**: Your question contains two different types of requests:
   • A mathematical calculation (multiply 9 and 8)
   • A general knowledge question (capital of Japan)

2. **Level 2 Limitation**: The current system can only handle one type of operation at a time

3. **Recommended Approach**: Please ask these questions separately:
   • First: "What is 9 times 8?"
   • Then: "What is the capital of Japan?"

4. **Why This Matters**: This ensures each part gets the appropriate tool (calculator for math, LLM for knowledge)

5. **Future Enhancement**: Level 3 will support multi-step processing to handle such complex queries

This limitation helps maintain accuracy and proper tool usage for each type of question.
